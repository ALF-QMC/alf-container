# Jupyter image with ALF + pyALF prerequisites

This image has all prerequisites for [ALF](https://github.com/ALF-QMC/ALF) and [pyALF](https://github.com/ALF-QMC/pyALF) installed.
Since it is derived from quay.io/jupyter/scipy-notebook, [this documentation](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io) applies.
