# Jupyter image with ALF + pyALF prerequisites

This image has all prerequisites for [ALF](https://git.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ALF/ALF) and [pyALF](https://git.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ALF/pyALF) installed. Since it is derived from jupyter/minimal-notebook, [this documentation](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io) applies.
