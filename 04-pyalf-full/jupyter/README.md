# ALF + pyALF Jupyter Container

This image includes the source code of [ALF](https://github.com/ALF-QMC/ALF) and [pyALF](https://github.com/ALF-QMC/pyALF), has their prerequisites installed and HDF5 precompiled. Since it is derived from jupyter/minimal-notebook, [this documentation](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io) applies.
